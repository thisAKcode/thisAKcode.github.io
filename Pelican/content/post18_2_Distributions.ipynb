    "### Introduction\n",
    "A probability distribution in statistics is a function that returns the possible values for a variable with different occurence rate (how often values occur). Distribution in nature and society tend to fit pattern with ocasionally occuring exceptions (isn't absence of pattern is a pattern too?).\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Probability Mass Function\n",
    "Discrete random variable has probability mass function (PMF) being a particular type of *probability distribution* that defines the probability of observing some value given particular parameter. Random variables and corresponding probability distributions may be applied on many different kinds of problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions have parameters that make them adaptable for different situations. Here I named a few common distributions:\n",
    "* Normal Distribution\n",
    "* Binomial Distribution\n",
    "* Poisson Distribution\n",
    "* Exponential Distribution\n",
    "* Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "These are many other distributions. All distributions are used to model data depending on its characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Variables\n",
    "Data is described using variables. Given a random variable FOO you can get different values. Think of your values that variable FOO can take as a output from some model. You can estimate probability of different outcomes for variable FOO. A probability distribution function assigns probabilies to values that FOO can possibly take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables represent random events: the outcome of a die roll represents integers from one to six. Random variables are often numeric, and in order to represent categorical data for events with non-numeric outcomes, we can assigned numbers to represent those outcomes: \"heads\" a value of 1 and \"tails\" a value of 0. Here we have a code to simulate random outcomes occuring several times:"

    "* discrete variables are assigned one of a specified collection of values: count of two Fair Coins/Dices.\n",
    "* continuous (arbitrarily exact values): time, speed.\n",
    "* mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Discrete* variables are taking count values on a specified list (pixels, coins, votes) Think of light bulb, you can buy one or many, but can't buy half a bulb, neither 0.3 because these are uncountable. In this case, the values must be countable in that they are limited to whole numbers.If you one day buy less than one or one and a half, I then will need to update this article!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Continuous* variables are taking precise  values from a range of values that are pecise (temperature, time, height). The value of 3.141592, as well as more precise values of pi are uncountable. Continuous variables progressively take the values more and more precise- each value from range of descriptive values must exist in order to arrive at the next one. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I drink some water (which I really do sometimes) the volume of my randomly chosen glass is a perfectly continuous variable taking values all the time even if I am not aware of every floating point value of volume that I am swallowing, wich is fine - measurements can always be more precise but I do not have time to think about all of them. Chances are good my drinking example made you thinking about *mixed* variables always having discrete component and continuous component. "

    "\n",
    "    n for the number of events/ trials (eg., n=10 if we flip a coin 10 times)\n",
    "    p for the probability of success in each trial (probability of observing a particular outcome in each trial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, p= 0.5 because the probability of observing heads on a fair coin flip is 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe 10 events and multiply it by the chance of getting success (one-half) then we apply the equation for the expected value of the binomial distribution.\n",
