Hi, I am Alex and I create a collection of tips and instructions useful to me.<br />

Year 2018 a was non-programmer with ambition to automate some GIS workflows. <br />
I started with ETL software FME, then I learned (and still learning) Python. I enjoy solve problems with that language. <br />
Otherwise I am dad and husband which might explain the intensity level of the article flow here. <br />
